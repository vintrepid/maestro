# Maestro

Project orchestration and agent coordination hub.

## Project Tasks

### Current: Agent Startup Optimization

**The Problem:** AI agents spend enormous amounts of time, money, and tokens loading all guidelines at session start. We need to solve this by loading only what's needed for specific tasks.

**The Solution:**
- **Maestro** (this project): Reads entire `agents/` directory to have full context for coordinating work
- **Other projects**: Load minimal essential guidelines at startup
- **Task-specific loading**: When we assign a task to another project, Maestro tells them exactly what guidelines they need to read
- **Usage tracking**: Track which guidelines agents actually reference during work to optimize future sessions

**How it works:**
1. Maestro plans tasks for other projects here
2. Maestro writes the task with specific reading requirements to the project's CHANGELOG
3. That project's agent starts up, reads minimal guidelines + task-specific ones
4. Agent logs which guidelines were actually used (server log style)
5. We analyze logs to optimize what to load by default

**Current status:**
- ‚úÖ Maestro reads everything (agents/ directory)
- ‚úÖ Other project startup files created (minimal loading)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è GUIDELINE_USAGE_TRACKER exists but not being used as intended
- üîÑ Need to implement usage logging (agent-oriented, like server logs)
- üîÑ Need to test with other projects loading minimal set

### Completed: CSS Linter Integration

**Branch:** feature/css-linter

**Goal:** Move Tailwind analysis UI from Maestro to css_linter tool, making it reusable across all projects.

**Status:** ‚úÖ Working, needs migration for full functionality

**What was done:**
- Copied TailwindAnalysisLive to css_linter package
- Refactored to be repo-agnostic and mountable from any app
- Added LiveTable dependency to css_linter
- Configured and mounted in Maestro (separate scope to avoid namespace collision)

**Remaining:**
- Run migration for css_class_usage table
- Test UI functionality
- Remove old Maestro-specific analysis files
- Document web UI usage in css_linter

### Access Points

- **Web App**: http://localhost:4004
- **Live Debugger**: http://localhost:4012

## Managing the Agents Directory

Maestro is responsible for managing `~/dev/agents/` - the central repository of shared knowledge for all projects.

**What Maestro manages:**
- **Guidelines** (`bootstrap/`, `ui_work/`, `database_work/`, etc.) - Core patterns and best practices
- **Usage Rules** (`usage_rules/`) - Package-specific guidelines from dependencies and our forks
- **Bundles** (`bundles/`) - Consolidated guideline sets for efficient loading
- **Sessions** (`sessions/`) - Archived learnings from agent sessions
- **Logs** (`logs/`) - Session tracking data for optimization

**Key responsibilities:**
- Sync upstream changes from frameworks (e.g., Phoenix AGENTS.md ‚Üí `bootstrap/PHOENIX_AGENTS.md`)
- Build and maintain usage_rules bundles using `mix usage_rules.sync`
- Extract learnings from sessions using `mix session.learn`
- Generate concept maps and relationships between guidelines
- Track guideline usage to optimize startup bundles

**Why this matters:** Other projects consume from this directory but Maestro is the orchestrator that maintains it. This ensures all projects have access to current, well-organized knowledge without duplication.

## Orchestration Features

Current features:
- **Project Dashboard**: View status of all projects
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track which projects are running (ProjectMonitor GenServer checks TCP ports every 10s)
- **Guideline Browser**: Visual tree of all agent guidelines
- **LiveTable Integration**: Uses vintrepid/live_table fork with DaisyUI styling

Planned features:
- **Task Planning**: Create and assign tasks to other projects
- **Usage Analytics**: Track which guidelines are actually referenced
- **Smart Loading**: Recommend minimal guideline set based on task type
- **Multi-Project Commands**: Start/stop multiple projects
- **Log Aggregation**: View logs from all projects
- **Environment Management**: Manage .env files across projects

## Technical Details

### Project Monitoring
- ProjectMonitor GenServer checks TCP ports every 10s
- LiveView updates UI every 5s
- Real-time status indicators (green=running, red=stopped)

### Dashboard
- Uses LiveTable component from vintrepid/live_table fork
- DaisyUI styling with table-pin-rows for fixed headers
- Sortable and searchable project listing

### Guideline Browser
- Visual tree view of entire agents directory
- Helps agents understand available documentation
- Checkbox tracking (UI-only, not persisted)

### Database
- Uses Ash Framework with PostgreSQL
- Ecto for css_linter integration (Ash not compatible with LiveTable)
- Seeds include 6 projects: Ready, Calvin, SanJuan, new_project, Maestro, np
