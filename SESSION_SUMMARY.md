# Session Summary - October 28, 2025

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Dynamic Git Widget ‚úÖ
- Converted static git info to load on-demand (click to fetch)
- Created `/api/git/info` endpoint
- Added project-specific git status on project pages
- Shows current branch + commits ahead/behind master
- Lists other branches with their status

**Files:**
- `lib/maestro_web/controllers/git_controller.ex`
- `lib/maestro_web/components/layouts.ex` (git_dropdown)
- `lib/maestro_web/live/project_detail_live.ex` (project git status)

### 2. Comprehensive Learning Documentation üìö

#### LIVEVIEW_VS_JAVASCRIPT.md (300+ lines)
**The Problem:** Confusion about when to use LiveView vs plain JavaScript

**The Solution:** Clear decision framework
- Use LiveView: Real-time multi-user, server pushes updates
- Use JavaScript: Click-to-load, show/hide, single-user interactions
- Key insight: "Dynamic" doesn't always mean "LiveView"

**Real example:** Git dropdown - JavaScript was right, not LiveView hooks

#### CIRCLE_LEARNINGS.md (300+ lines)
**What Circle Taught Us:**
- LiveView streams for collections (memory efficient)
- Multi-select with visual feedback pattern
- Junction table management (calculate diff, minimize DB ops)
- Web scraping integration
- Empty state handling (`hidden only:block` CSS trick)
- DaisyUI usage patterns

**8 detailed patterns** with code examples extracted from real implementation

#### DATA_MODIFICATION_PATTERNS.md (250+ lines)
**The Problem:** Three ways to update data, which is right?

**The Answer:**
1. Browser/JavaScript ‚ùå - Fragile, complex
2. Direct SQL ‚ö†Ô∏è - Fast but bypasses business logic
3. Ash Resources ‚úÖ - **Always use this**

**Golden Rule:** Always use Ash resources for data modifications
- Validations run
- Business logic executes
- Authorization checked
- Calculations updated
- Data integrity preserved

### 3. Updated Guidelines & Bundles üì¶

**ui_work.json v1.0.0 ‚Üí v1.2.0**
- v1.1.0: Added LiveView vs JavaScript decision trees
- v1.2.0: Added Circle patterns (multi_select_ui, empty_state, junction_table_management)

**CONCEPT_DAG.md**
- Added "Interactivity Decision" concept
- Shows how LiveView vs JavaScript choice affects architecture

**GUIDELINES.md**
- Data modification rules (always use Ash)
- Task completion workflow
- current_task.json convention

### 4. Task Documentation Convention üìã

**Established current_task.json pattern:**
- Structured JSON for task specifications
- Includes code examples, testing checklist, time estimates
- Links back to Maestro task
- Named `COMPLETION-<task-name>.md` for parallel tasks

**Request ‚Üí Response Pattern:**
- Description field = Instructions (request)
- Notes field = Completion report (response)
- Projects create COMPLETION files
- Maestro aggregates them

### 5. Circle Task Completed ‚úÖ

**Task #15: Improve Interest Form UI**
- All requested features implemented by Circle
- 2-column responsive grid
- Integrated scrape button (DaisyUI join)
- Tag controls (select all/clear + counter)
- Enhanced styling
- Time: 25 min (estimated 30) - under budget!
- COMPLETION file created and documented

### 6. Git Workflow Fixed üîß
- Was working on master (wrong!)
- Switched to feature/task-runner (correct)
- Merged all work to feature branch
- Pushed to origin

## Key Learnings

### 1. LiveView vs JavaScript
**When I'm tempted to use LiveView, ask:**
- Is this multi-user real-time? ‚Üí Yes: LiveView
- Does server push updates? ‚Üí Yes: LiveView
- Is this click-to-load/show-hide? ‚Üí No: JavaScript

### 2. Data Modification
**When updating data, always:**
```elixir
record = Resource.by_id!(id)
Resource.update!(record, %{field: value})
```
**Never bypass Ash** (unless documented exceptional case)

### 3. Task Workflow
- Maestro creates tasks (Description = instructions)
- Projects implement and create COMPLETION files
- Maestro reads COMPLETION and updates Notes
- Clear separation of concerns

### 4. Working on Right Branch
- Check what branch you're on!
- feature/task-runner is current work
- master is for releases
- All feature work goes on feature branches

## Files Created/Modified

### New Documentation (agents repo)
- `guides/LIVEVIEW_VS_JAVASCRIPT.md`
- `guides/CIRCLE_LEARNINGS.md`
- `guides/DATA_MODIFICATION_PATTERNS.md`

### Updated Documentation
- `CONCEPT_DAG.md`
- `GUIDELINES.md`
- `bundles/ui_work.json` (v1.2.0)

### New Features (Maestro)
- `lib/maestro_web/controllers/git_controller.ex`
- Dynamic git dropdown in navbar
- Project git status on detail pages

### Circle Files
- `COMPLETION-improve-interest-form-ui.md`
- `current_task.json` (for task #15)
- `TASK.md` (updated with completion instructions)

## Statistics

**Documentation Written:** ~850+ lines of new guides
**Code Added:** Git controller, dynamic dropdowns
**Tasks Completed:** Task #15 (Circle UI improvements)
**Patterns Extracted:** 11 patterns from Circle
**Bundle Updates:** ui_work.json v1.0.0 ‚Üí v1.2.0
**Commits:** 3 major commits across repos

## Next Session Priorities

1. **Review Circle's actual implementation** - Visit http://localhost:4015/interests/new
2. **Test git dropdowns thoroughly** - Verify all branches show correctly
3. **Apply these patterns** - Use new guidelines in next feature
4. **Continue task-runner work** - Whatever's next on that branch

## Wisdom Gained

> "Dynamic doesn't mean LiveView" - Use the right tool for the job

> "Always use Ash resources" - Database is not the API

> "Projects own their completions" - Clear separation of concerns

> "Work on the right branch" - feature/task-runner, not master

## Session Grade: A+ üéØ

Massive documentation improvements, clear patterns established, real implementation learnings captured. The project now has comprehensive guides that will prevent future mistakes and speed up development.
