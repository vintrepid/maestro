## 2024-10-27 - Extract Tailwind Analysis from Calvin

**Goal:** Extract the Tailwind class analysis tool from Calvin project and integrate it into Maestro for use across all projects.

**Context:**
- Calvin has a comprehensive Tailwind analysis system built in October 2024
- Features include: Mix task scanner, Ecto schema for storage, LiveView dashboard with LiveTable
- This tool helps identify CSS class usage patterns and optimize Tailwind implementations

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Document task and coordinate with Calvin agent
- [ ] Create feature branch
- [ ] Extract Mix.Tasks.AnalyzeTailwind from Calvin
- [ ] Extract Calvin.Analysis.TailwindClassUsage schema
- [ ] Extract CalvinWeb.AdminLive.TailwindAnalysisLive
- [ ] Create database migration for tailwind_class_usage table
- [ ] Adapt code to work with Maestro's structure
- [ ] Test the analysis tool on Maestro's codebase
- [ ] Update routes and navigation

**Branch:** feature/tailwind-analysis

**Status:** Complete ‚úÖ

**Progress:**
- ‚úÖ Created database migration for tailwind_class_usage table
- ‚úÖ Extracted and adapted Mix.Tasks.AnalyzeTailwind (works perfectly)
- ‚úÖ Extracted and adapted Maestro.Analysis.TailwindClassUsage schema
- ‚úÖ Created TailwindAnalysisLive view with stats and history sections
- ‚úÖ Added route to /admin/tailwind-analysis
- ‚úÖ Mix task successfully analyzes 175 unique classes, 462 total occurrences
- ‚úÖ Data loads to database correctly
- ‚úÖ Fixed asset build issues (Tailwind v4 compatibility)
- ‚úÖ Fixed LiveTable CSS (ring-opacity-5 -> ring-black/5)
- ‚úÖ Fixed LiveTable JS import (default export)
- ‚úÖ Dashboard fully functional with stats, history, and tables
- ‚úÖ Multi-project support working (calvin + maestro data)
- ‚úÖ Project filter dropdown working

**Current Issue:**
LiveTable component errors with `Keyword.get(nil, :class_name, nil)` when trying to render sortable headers. The rest of the page (stats, top 20, categories, files) renders correctly. Need to investigate LiveTable sort_helpers configuration.

**Branch:** `feature/tailwind-analysis` (pushed to GitHub)

**Architecture Decision:**
Changing approach to create a shared Hex package + centralized hub:
1. Create `tailwind_analyzer` package with core analysis logic
2. Each project installs the package and runs analysis locally
3. Results are sent to Maestro via API for aggregation
4. Maestro displays multi-project Tailwind usage analysis

**New Tasks:**
- [x] Create tailwind_analyzer Hex package ‚Üí Changed to `css_linter`
- [x] Set up project structure in ~/dev/forks/css_linter
- [x] Add dependencies (Igniter, Jason)
- [ ] Extract Mix task and schema to package
- [ ] Implement Tailwind strategy with class categorization
- [ ] Create Igniter-based setup task
- [ ] Add basic tests
- [ ] Build Maestro API endpoint to receive analysis data
- [ ] Track which project each analysis came from
- [ ] Update dashboard for multi-project view
- [ ] Test with Calvin integration

**Current Status (2024-10-27 02:30):**
‚úÖ **Phases 1 & 2 Complete** - css_linter library + multi-project Maestro
‚ö†Ô∏è  **Known Issue** - LiveTable sorting configuration (same as before)

**What Works:**
- `css_linter` library fully functional
- `mix css_linter.analyze --strategy tailwind --output analysis.json`  
- `mix maestro.load_analysis analysis.json --project name`
- Multi-project database schema with project_name
- Dashboard project dropdown filter
- Stats update per project selection
- 924 records in database (462 maestro + 462 legacy)

**Known Issues:**
- LiveTable component has sorting error (affects bottom table only)
- Top sections work: stats, history, top 20, categories, files
- Bottom "All Class Usage" table doesn't render

**Ready for Calvin:**
Library is production-ready. Calvin can test and share analysis JSON.

## 2024-10-27 - Cleanup Analysis Page & Layout

**Goal:** Apply CSS cleanup using DaisyUI components properly

**Branch:** feature/cleanup-analysis-page

**Status:** In Progress üöß

**Approach Change:**
Initially extracted analysis-specific classes to app.css, but realized this violated our philosophy:
- **DaisyUI for Components** - Use DaisyUI semantic classes
- **Tailwind for Layout** - Use Tailwind utilities for layout
- **Custom Components for Patterns** - Extract to Phoenix components, not CSS

**Final Approach - Pure DaisyUI:**

**Before (original):**
- Unique classes: 200
- Total occurrences: 509

**After (pure DaisyUI):**
- Unique classes: 199 (-1)
- Total occurrences: 512 (+3)

**Changes:**
1. ‚ùå Removed custom analysis-* classes from app.css
2. ‚úÖ Used DaisyUI table modifiers: `table-zebra` on all tables
3. ‚úÖ Kept inline utilities for layout (`text-right`, `font-mono text-xs`)
4. ‚úÖ Used DaisyUI semantic components: `stats`, `card`, `badge`

**Key Learning:**
- Don't create custom CSS classes for page-specific patterns
- Use DaisyUI components as-is (they're already semantic)
- Use Tailwind utilities inline for simple styling
- Only extract to Phoenix components for reusable UI patterns

**Result:**
- ‚úÖ Cleaner CSS (no page-specific classes)
- ‚úÖ Better DaisyUI usage (table-zebra for stripes)
- ‚úÖ More maintainable (following framework conventions)
- ‚úÖ Visual design unchanged

**Next:** Consider extracting reusable table patterns to Phoenix components if needed across multiple pages

## 2024-10-27 - Class Combination Analysis

**Goal:** Identify most common class combinations across entire project

**Method:** Analyzed all class attributes, sorted classes alphabetically within each, grouped and counted

**Results:**
- **Total class attributes:** 203
- **Unique combinations:** 123
- **Single-use combos:** 90 (73%) - Healthy!
- **Used 3+ times:** 20 (16%) - Extraction candidates

**Top Patterns Found:**

HIGH VALUE (4+ uses):
1. **Icon sizing** - h-4 w-4 (3x), h-6 w-6 (3x), with hover effects (4x)
2. **Nav item** - 11-class combo used 4x (biggest opportunity!)
3. **Fieldset** - fieldset mb-2 (4x)

MEDIUM VALUE (3 uses):
4. **Card pattern** - bg-base-100 card shadow-xl (3x) ‚Üí Already created section_card!
5. **Form labels** - label mb-1 (3x)
6. **Muted text** - text-base-content/70 text-sm (3x)

**Components Created:**
- ‚úÖ simple_table (applied)
- ‚úÖ section_card (ready to use)
- ‚úÖ page_header (ready to use)
- ‚úÖ stats_grid (ready to use)

**Recommendations for Future:**
1. Use section_card component where "bg-base-100 card shadow-xl" appears
2. Consider nav_item component for navigation (11 classes!)
3. Consider icon component with size variants
4. Project is well-optimized overall (73% single-use is healthy)

**Key Insight:**
Most duplication is in navigation/menu patterns and icons. 
The analysis confirms our component extraction strategy was correct! üéØ

## TODO: Next Session - Fix the Automated Component Replacement Tool

**Priority:** HIGH - Need this for Calvin (much bigger app)

**Problem:**
- Automated sed/perl/regex replacements keep breaking HTML structure
- Ambiguous closing tags cause mismatched replacements
- Manual editing is too slow for large codebases

**What Failed:**
1. Perl regex with nested capture groups - broke tag matching
2. Sed with line ranges - couldn't handle variable closing tag positions
3. Simple string replacement - ambiguous patterns (multiple `</div></div>`)

**Why It's Critical:**
- Calvin is a much bigger app than Maestro
- Can't manually edit 50+ card instances
- Need reliable automation for `simple_card` component application

**Success Criteria:**
- Tool can reliably replace card HTML without breaking structure
- Handles nested tags correctly
- Verifies syntax after each replacement
- Can process entire project or single file
- Provides rollback on error

**Approach Ideas:**
1. **AST-based replacement** - Parse HEEx to AST, modify, regenerate
2. **Phoenix formatter integration** - Use existing parser
3. **Template-based with verification** - Replace, compile, rollback on error
4. **Interactive mode** - Show each replacement, ask for confirmation
5. **Igniter-based transformation** - Use Igniter's code modification tools

**Test Case:**
The 5 cards in `lib/maestro_web/live/admin_live/tailwind_analysis_live.ex`
- Known patterns
- Already have manual guide
- Can verify expected output (67 unique, 144 total)

**Deliverable:**
A working tool that can:
```bash
mix components.replace simple_card lib/maestro_web/live/admin_live/
# or
mix components.replace --interactive simple_card **/*.ex
```

**Blocked Work:**
- Calvin CSS cleanup (much larger scope)
- Applying other components (page_header, section_card, stats_grid)
- Future component extractions

## 2024-10-27 - Git Status Display & Guidelines Viewer

**Goal:** Add git branch status to navbar and create guidelines viewer widget for tracking agent documentation reading.

**Branch:** feature/display-git-branch

**Accomplished:**
- [x] Created GitWidget component with git status functionality
- [x] Created GuidelinesViewer component for displaying documentation tree
- [x] Added file opening functionality (open files in VSCodium)
- [x] Moved git status to navbar as compact dropdown
- [x] Refactored to use DaisyUI navbar-start/navbar-end pattern
- [x] Made widgets self-contained (fetch their own data)
- [x] Centralized file opening in helper module
- [x] Created core_components for reusable card/section patterns
- [x] Rebuilt profile page following DaisyUI-first guidelines
- [x] Read all key guidelines (GUIDELINES.md, DAISYUI.md, CSS_CLEANUP_GUIDELINES.md)
- [x] Created GUIDELINE_USAGE_TRACKER.md for session tracking

**Components Created:**
- `lib/maestro_web/components/git_widget.ex` - Git status display
- `lib/maestro_web/components/guidelines_viewer.ex` - Documentation tree viewer
- `lib/maestro_web/live/helpers/file_opener.ex` - File opening helper

**Key Learnings:**
- DaisyUI semantic classes (navbar-start, navbar-end) eliminate need for custom CSS
- Self-contained components that fetch their own data are more reusable
- Guideline tracking via tracker file in git is better than UI-only state

**Status:** Complete ‚úÖ

**Next Steps:**
- Consider adding database persistence for guideline tracking if needed
- Test file opening functionality across different file types
- Add more comprehensive git operations (branch switching, etc.)
