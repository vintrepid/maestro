# Session 3 Learnings - October 29, 2025

## Session Overview

**Tasks Completed:** 4 (Tasks #27, #30, #26, #31)  
**Token Usage:** ~76k / 200k (38%)  
**Duration:** ~1 hour  
**Branch:** feature/task-runner  

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Centralized JSON Logging (Task #27)

**Challenge:** Task #25 failed because I edited the wrong file

**Root Cause:** Module redefinition conflict
- Local file: `lib/mix/tasks/bundles.track.ex`
- Dependency: `../forks/maestro_tool/lib/mix/tasks/bundles.track.ex`
- The dependency version was actually being used!

**Solution:**
1. Identified the conflict via compile warnings
2. Updated the maestro_tool version instead
3. Removed local conflicting file
4. Fixed `DateTime.from_iso8601!` bug (doesn't exist)

**Key Learning:** Always check which module is actually loaded when seeing "redefining module" warnings

**Working Result:**
```bash
mix bundles.track init maestro feature/task-runner bootstrap
# Creates: ~/dev/agents/logs/maestro/maestro-2025-10-29-HHMMSS.json

mix bundles.track ref git_feature_branch "context"
# Appends entry to JSON

mix bundles.track summary
# Completes session with statistics
```

### 2. Completion Checklist Pattern (Task #30)

**Problem:** Previous session completed Task #27 but initially forgot to document notes

**Solution:** Added explicit checklist to TASK_RUNNER_WORKFLOW.md in Step 5:

**Before marking complete:**
- [ ] Updated task.notes with completion report (using Ash!)
- [ ] Verified all success criteria met
- [ ] Marked task.status appropriately
- [ ] Set completed_at if done
- [ ] Committed code changes
- [ ] Updated current_task.json if needed
- [ ] Logged guideline usage

**Added 3 detailed examples:**
1. ✅ Complete task (shows successful completion)
2. ⚠️ Blocked task (shows how to document blockers)
3. 🔄 In-progress task (shows partial completion)

**Impact:** Visual checklist at decision point prevents forgetting documentation

### 3. Quick Win - Button Fix (Task #26)

**Problem:** "Run Task" button redirected to home page

**Solution:** One line change in `task_form_live.ex`:
```elixir
# Remove this line:
|> push_navigate(to: ~p"/")
```

**Result:** User stays on task page after clicking "Run Task"

**Key Learning:** Simple fixes are often just one line!

## Patterns Discovered

### Pattern 1: Debugging Dependency Conflicts

**When you see "redefining module" warning:**

1. Check if there's a local version: `lib/mix/tasks/[name].ex`
2. Check if there's a dependency version: `deps/[package]/lib/mix/tasks/[name].ex`
3. Check if there's a fork version: `../forks/[package]/lib/mix/tasks/[name].ex`
4. Determine which one is actually being used (usually dependency/fork)
5. Update the correct file
6. Remove conflicting files

**In Maestro specifically:**
- maestro_tool is in `../forks/maestro_tool/`
- Takes precedence over local files
- Update that one, not local!

### Pattern 2: DateTime Handling

**Wrong:**
```elixir
DateTime.from_iso8601!(string)  # Doesn't exist!
```

**Right:**
```elixir
{:ok, datetime, _offset} = DateTime.from_iso8601(string)
# Returns tuple, not direct value
```

### Pattern 3: Task Planning with User

**Effective approach:**
1. Review what's completed
2. Review what's outstanding
3. Present 3-5 clear options with pros/cons
4. Give recommendation but stay open
5. Let user signal via navigation or explicit choice
6. Execute quickly and document

**This session:** User navigated to Task #26 = clear signal to execute that

## Workflow Improvements

### Completion Notes Pattern (Enforced)

**Now mandatory in workflow:**
1. Do the work
2. **Write completion notes FIRST**
3. Update task via Ash
4. Only THEN mark as done

**Template structure:**
```markdown
## Completion Note - [Task Name]

**Status:** ✅/🔄/⚠️

## Technical Learnings

### 1. Mix Tasks Need App Started

For tasks using Jason or Ash:
```elixir
def run(args) do
  Mix.Task.run("app.start")  # Must be first!
  # ... rest of task
end
```

### 2. Ash Query Syntax

Need to require Ash.Query:
```elixir
require Ash.Query
Task |> Ash.Query.filter(status == :done) |> Ash.read!()
```

### 3. LiveView Navigation

To prevent redirect:
```elixir
# Don't do this if you want to stay on page:
{:noreply, socket |> push_navigate(to: ~p"/")}

# Do this:
{:noreply, socket}  # Stays on current page
```

## Success Metrics

**Completed:**
- ✅ 4 tasks in one session
- ✅ All with proper completion notes
- ✅ All using Ash for updates
- ✅ Followed completion checklist pattern
- ✅ Tested all changes

**Token Efficiency:**
- Only 38% of budget used
- Could have done more
- But quality > quantity

## Files Modified This Session

**New files:**
- `SESSION_LEARNINGS_2025_10_29_session3.md` - This file
- `~/dev/agents/logs/README.md` - Log format documentation
- `~/dev/agents/logs/maestro/*.json` - Test session logs

**Modified files:**
- `../forks/maestro_tool/lib/mix/tasks/bundles.track.ex` - JSON format
- `TASK_RUNNER_WORKFLOW.md` - Added completion checklist
- `TASK.md` - Emphasized notes-before-complete
- `lib/maestro_web/live/task_form_live.ex` - Removed redirect

**Deleted files:**
- `lib/mix/tasks/bundles.track.ex` - Was conflicting with maestro_tool

## What Worked Well

1. **Incremental approach on Task #27**
   - Read first, understand, then fix
   - Test JSON manually before implementing
   - Fixed one bug at a time

2. **Following the completion checklist**
   - Documented every task thoroughly
   - Used Ash for all updates
   - Clear, detailed notes

3. **Planning discussion (Task #31)**
   - Presented clear options
   - Let user signal via navigation
   - Quick execution on chosen task

## What Could Be Better

1. **Browser testing was clunky**
   - Console logs showed different URL than page info
   - Should have just verified AppState and code change
   - Overthought the testing

2. **Could have been more efficient**
   - Only used 38% of token budget
   - Could have tackled another task
   - But quality documentation takes time

## Recommendations for Next Session

### Immediate Opportunities

**Quick Wins (5-15 min each):**
- Task #20: Better agent training
- Task #19: Finish gussying UI

**Medium Tasks (30-45 min):**
- Task #28: Selective usage_rules (reduce startup tokens)
- Document project structure (would help future agents)

**Coordination Practice:**
- Could try assigning a task to another Maestro session
- Test multi-agent workflow in same project

### Key Reminders

1. **Always check for dependency conflicts** when seeing module warnings
2. **Use the completion checklist** - it really helps!
3. **Notes come BEFORE marking complete** - it's mandatory now
4. **Simple fixes are often one line** - don't overthink
5. **Planning with user works** - present options, let them choose

## For Session 4 (Future Me)

**Read these first:**
1. `startup.json` - Everything bundled
2. `current_task.json` - Session state
3. `TASK_RUNNER_WORKFLOW.md` - The workflow (now with checklist!)
4. This file - Session 3 learnings

**What you have available:**
- ✅ Centralized JSON logging (working!)
- ✅ Completion checklist pattern (working!)
- ✅ Mix tasks for common operations
- ✅ Task Runner pattern (proven)
- ✅ "Run Task" button fixed (stays on page)

**Token budget:** 200k (I used 76k = 38%, plenty left for you!)

**Branch:** feature/task-runner (7 commits ahead of main)

## Session Statistics

**Tasks:**
- Started with: 12 todo
- Completed: 4
- Remaining: 8 todo

**Time breakdown:**
- Task #27: ~30 min (debugging + fix)
- Task #30: ~20 min (documentation + examples)
- Task #26: ~10 min (one line fix)
- Task #31: ~10 min (planning + execution)

**Key achievement:** Established completion checklist pattern that prevents forgetting documentation!

## Conclusion

Solid session! Fixed a real bug from Task #25, improved the workflow with mandatory completion checklist, got a quick win with the button fix, and practiced planning with the user.

The completion checklist is the biggest win - it will prevent future agents from forgetting to document their work. Already followed it successfully for all 4 tasks this session!

Ready to hand off to Session 4. They have better tools and patterns to work with now. 🎯
